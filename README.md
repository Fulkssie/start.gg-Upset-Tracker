# start.gg-Upset-Tracker
Gets an event from a start.gg bracket and records the upsets

### Issues
- #### Start.gg documentation is not very good
  - Essentially I did trial and error to get what I needed.
  - Edit: I found out how to explore the schemas, which was good.
- #### Code suddenly returned Error 403: Forbidden
  - Swapped from GraphQL to Requests, which fixed the error. Genuinely not sure what broke it.
- #### Had issues pushing to repo
  - had to rebase
